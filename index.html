    <p id="bio">Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Gujarati" target="_blank">(Gujarati: [ʋəlːəbːʰɑi dʒʰəʋeɾbʰɑi pəʈel];</a>  pə-TEL; 31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950), commonly known as Sardar Patel,[a] was an Indian lawyer, influential political leader, barristerand statesman who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947 to 1950. He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a leading role in the country's
        struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united, independent nation.[1] In India and elsewhere,
        he was often called Sardar, meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister
        during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sardar Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district, and raised in the countryside of
        the state of Gujarat.He
        was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from
        Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of
        the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress,
        organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief
        efforts for partition
        refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. He led the task of forging a
        united India, successfully integrating into the newly independent nation those British colonial provinces that
        formed the Dominion of India. Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately
        565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of
        1947. Patel persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India. His commitment to national integration in
        the newly independent country was total and uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet "Iron Man of India".He
        is also remembered as the "patron saint of India's civil servants" for having established the modern All India
        Services system.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian
        government at a cost of US$420
        million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height.
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel,one of the six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba,
        was born in Nadiad, Gujarat. He followed Vaishnavism and belonged to Pushtimarg sect of Mahaprabhu
        Vallabhacharya and took the diksha from the descendant of Vallabhacharya.Patel's date of birth was never
        officially recorded; Patel entered it as 31 October on his matriculation examination papers.He belonged to the
        Leva Patel community of Central Gujarat, although after his fame, both Leva Patel and Kadava Patidar have
        claimed him as one of their own.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Patel travelled to attend schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living
        self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. Patel practised law in Godhra,
        Borsad, and Anand while taking on the financial burdens of his homestead in Karamsad. Patel was the first
        chairman and founder of "Edward Memorial High School" Borsad, today known as Jhaverbhai Dajibhai Patel High
        School.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In September 1917, Patel delivered a speech in Borsad, encouraging Indians nationwide
        to sign Gandhi's petition demanding Swaraj – self-rule – from Britain. A month later, he met Gandhi for the
        first time at the Gujarat Political Conference in Godhra. On Gandhi's encouragement, Patel became the secretary
        of the Gujarat Sabha, a public body that would become the Gujarati arm of the Indian National Congress. Patel
        now energetically fought against veth – the forced servitude of Indians to Europeans – and organised relief
        efforts in the wake of plague and famine in Kheda.The Kheda peasants' plea for exemption from taxation had been
        turned down by British authorities. Gandhi endorsed waging a struggle there, but could not lead it himself due
        to his activities in Champaran. When Gandhi asked for a Gujarati activist to devote himself completely to the
        assignment, Patel volunteered, much to Gandhi's delight.Though his decision was made on the spot, Patel later
        said that his desire and commitment came after intense personal contemplation, as he realised he would have to
        abandon his career and material ambitions.
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sarder Vallabhbhai Patel is also called IRON MAN OF INDIA.
